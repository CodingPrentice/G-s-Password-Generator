# G-s-Password-Generator
Wanted to attract the user with some friendly prompts

Created all the possible characters in a array to use.

Created some simple prompts for the user to answer to specialize what would the user like to be in their password.

Needed variables to  create to use to execute in the functions and for loops for the generator.

Would need to create some boolean statements for the user to determine whether to proceed and to again ask what are some specificities in the password.

To create the randomness the use of the for loop cooped with the math function is necessary to pull from the 'floor'(the greatest interger) paired with the random method
